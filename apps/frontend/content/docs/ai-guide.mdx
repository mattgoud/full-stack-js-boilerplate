## 1. Living Documentation

This project uses a **Living Documentation** strategy. The documentation is code, located in `apps/frontend/content/docs/`.

<Callout title="The Golden Rule">
  "Whenever you make a significant architectural change or update a workflow, you MUST update the corresponding documentation page in the same PR."
</Callout>

### The Verification Workflow

To ensure the documentation stays in sync, the project uses automated checks:

1. **Detection**: A dedicated script `./.gemini/scripts/verify-docs.sh` compares code changes with documentation updates.
2. **Security**: The `Security-Check` tool (`verify-security.sh`) scans for secrets and unwanted files before commit.
3. **IA Mandate**: The `.gemini/rules.md` forces the agent to run these checks before finalizing any task.
4. **Registry**: These tools are registered in `.gemini/tools.md`.

#### How to use the workflow:

- **AI Agent**: Will automatically run `verify-docs.sh` and warn you if you forgot to document a feature.
- **Manual**: You can run the check anytime to see if your docs are lagging behind your features.

#### Example:
If you modify `apps/backend/src/users/users.service.ts` but don't touch `apps/frontend/content/docs/backend.mdx`, the `Doc-Check` tool will trigger a warning.

### Search Engine (Orama)

The documentation features a full-text search engine powered by **Orama**.

- **Dynamic Indexing**: There is **no manual indexing step**. The search results are generated on-the-fly via the `/api/search` route.
- **Instant Sync**: As soon as you update an MDX file, the changes are reflected in the search results without rebuilding the application.
- **Granular Results**: The engine indexes content block by block, providing precise links to specific sections of the documentation.

## 2. Recommended MCP Servers

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** connects the AI directly to your environment.

| Server | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Filesystem | Read/Write access. Crucial for this boilerplate. |
| PostgreSQL | Debug schemas/queries via `docker compose`. |
| GitHub | Context from Issues and PRs. |

## 3. Optimizing Context (.gemini)

The `.gemini/` folder is the "Brain" of your project context.

<Cards>
  <Card title="context.md">
    High-level architecture & stack details.
  </Card>
  <Card title="rules.md">
    Strict commandments (e.g. "No Prettier").
  </Card>
  <Card title="skills.md">
    Recipes for complex tasks (migrations, new routes).
  </Card>
</Cards>

## 4. Effective Prompting Strategies

<Callout title="Task: Scaffolding a Page">
  "I need a new Dashboard page at `/analytics`.
  1. Use the 'Server First' pattern.
  2. Create a skeleton loading state.
  3. Use the `Overview` component for charts.
  4. Follow `Layout` wrapper from `app/layout.tsx`.
  Check `@repo/shared` for DTOs."
</Callout>

<Callout title="Task: Generating Shadcn Component" type="info">
  "I need to add a `Tabs` component.
  1. Use the CLI: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add tabs` in the frontend directory.
  2. Verify the component is created in `components/ui`.
  3. Use it in the target page following existing patterns."
