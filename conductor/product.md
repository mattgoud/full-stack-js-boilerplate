# Product Definition

## Initial Concept
A modern, high-performance monorepo boilerplate for building scalable web applications, optimized for developer experience and AI-first workflows.

## Target Audience
- **Full-stack Developers:** Seeking a robust, pre-configured starting point for production-ready applications.
- **Development Teams:** Looking for an AI-First foundation with integrated "Living Documentation" to maintain synchronization between code and docs.
- **SaaS Projects:** Requiring a scalable, strictly typed architecture that follows industry best practices.

## Core Vision
The boilerplate aims to eliminate the "blank page" problem for complex full-stack applications by providing a cohesive set of tools (NestJS, Next.js, Prisma, Turborepo) that work together seamlessly. It prioritizes strict typing, performance, and modern developer workflows, specifically tailored to be manipulated and understood by AI agents.

## Key Value Propositions
- **AI-First Design:** Custom rules and context provided for Gemini CLI and other LLMs.
- **Unified Types:** Shared DTOs and interfaces ensure end-to-end type safety.
- **Automated Documentation:** Integrated Fumadocs with verification scripts to prevent documentation rot.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Workspace-based organization allowing for independent service growth.
